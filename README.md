# Sample Appium Automation Suite # 

**Introduction**

Hi,
My name is Muhammad Waleed.
This is my Demo Appium + TestNG Profile, showcasing an automated testing suite for the Nahdi App. The suite is designed to demonstrate my skills in mobile automation testing using Appium, Java, TestNG, and Cucumber. Feel free to explore the code and see how I've implemented the test scenarios!

**Project Overview** 

This repository contains an automated testing suite using Appium for mobile application testing of the Nahdi App. The suite is built using Java, TestNG, and Cucumber for efficient test automation of mobile applications. It covers key functionalities like Login and Place Order, following best practices such as Page Object Model (POM) and clean code guidelines.

**Technologies Used**
- Appium
- Java
- TestNG
- Cucumber
- Maven (for managing dependencies)
- Android Emulator (or Physical Device for testing)

**Test Scenarios Automated**

Login Function: Automates the login using the provided credentials. Verifies that the login is successful.
Place Order: Automates the process of selecting a product, adding it to the cart, and proceeding through the checkout process. Verifies the order confirmation after completing the checkout.
